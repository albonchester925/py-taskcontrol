# taskcontrol  (py-taskcontrol)


##### Workflow Automation Library with support for Concurrent or Event based processes or activities in Local/Network Automation Tasks, including CI/CD activities.


* `taskcontrol (py-taskcontrol)` is a python library to create tasks in and based on named workflow controls. It allows middlewares before and after each task with support for concurrent processing. taskcontrol can run single or multiple tasks during task invocation/runs.
* It provides a simple decorator called `workflow` that takes arguments to set up the named workflow controls. It also provides methods to create a plugin and allow working with tasks as a module and/or pre-created ordered task list. Taskcontrol allows for scaling of plugin development with various utilities like authentication, logging, concurrency, sockets, events, publisher-subscriber architectures, webhooks, client-server http api servers etc.


[Actively Developed, Funding Invited]


# Features

* Create Named task controls (tasks) - instance and isolated
* Allows before / after middlewares for each task
* Access read-only contexts and results of middlewares/tasks
* Allows merging two instances of task controls with namespace clash handling
* Run instance, shared, and mix of tasks (individual or all groups)
* Allows working with Logging, Sockets, Events, Queues, Publisher-Subscriber Architectures, etc
* In-Development:
    * Allows support for / working with Concurrency
    * Allows working with Commands & Scripts (Todo), SSH (Todo), etc
    * Allows working with Files (Todo - normal, yaml, ini, and csv), Scheduling (Todo), etc
    * Allows working with ORMs/Databases (Todo), Authentication (Todo)
    * Allows working with best practices like Dependency Injection (Todo) within the library, tasks, and workflows
    * Allows creating, registering, and using tasks/workflows as a plugin
    * Provided in and Allows plugins support for Python, Javascript languages
    * Planned Integrations with Subversioning, Build Tools, Deployment
    * Planned Integrations with Data Transformation / Analytics Tooling
    * Planned Integrations with Testing, and Infrastructure Automation toolings
    * Monitoring Support

##### Quick Demo:

[demo example - main.py](https://github.com/taskcontrols/py-taskcontrol/blob/master/main.py)


```python



from taskcontrol import workflow, Tasks

sparrow = Tasks()

def middleware_trees(ctx, result, *args, **kwargs):
    print("Running my Middleware Function: middleware_trees - task items", args, kwargs)


@workflow(
    name="taskname",
    task_order=1,
    task_instance=sparrow,
    shared=False,
    args=[1, 2],
    kwargs={},
    before=[
        {
            "function": middleware_trees,
            "args": [11, 12],
            "kwargs": {"d": "Before Testing message Middleware "},
            "options": {"error": "next", "error_next_value": ""}
        }
    ],
    after=[
        {
            "function": middleware_trees,
            "args": [13, 14],
            "kwargs": {"d": "After Middleware Testing message"},
            "options": {
                "error": "error_handler",
                "error_next_value": "value",
                "error_handler": lambda err, value: (err, None)
            }
        }
    ],
    log=False
)
def taskone(ctx, result, *args, **kwargs):
    print("Running my task function: taskone", args, kwargs)


# Run single task
sparrow.run(tasks="taskname")


# Run all tasks
sparrow.run()
# sparrow.run(tasks=["1"])
# sparrow.run(tasks=["taskname", ..., "anothertask"])


```


##### Note:

Though it may support Python version 2.x. However, it has not been tested in 2.x. The Syntax and Features of the library supports Python version 2.x. Use at your own risk.

##### Crazy Hint:
You can also create a simple workflow without taskcontrol using a simple list or nested list and loop through them using a for/while loop and invoke them during looping


```python


# Loop the lists below and invoke the functions 
lst = ["f1", "f2", "f3"]
nest_lst = [["f1", "f2"], "f3", "f4", ["f5"]]


# Use a reducer if you want to send args to next function like below
def test(a,b):
    print(a,b)
    return {"a":a, "b":b}
def tester(a,b):
    print(a,b)
    return None

kwargs_for_first_function_the_its_returns_or_other_value_for_next_func = {"a":"a", "b":"b"}
ls = [kwargs_for_first_function_the_its_returns_or_other_value_for_next_func, test, tester]
import functools 
def red(kwargs_for_first_then_func, p):
    i = p(kwargs.get("a"), kwargs.get("b"))
    return i
functools.reduce(red, ls)


```

# [Todo](https://github.com/taskcontrols/py-taskcontrol/blob/master/.todo)


* e2e and Unit Tests - Add Tests (Structure of package created - to be cleaned after writing tests)
* Allow creating and registering a set of task controls as a plugin
* Allow working with commands (Todo), ssh (Todo), Files (Todo - normal, yaml, ini, json, and csv), Scheduling (Todo), Dependency Injection (Todo), ORMs/Databases (Todo), Authentication (Todo)
* [C?] Consider Workflow/Tasks tracking system and Dashboard with its own progress and logging
* [C?] Consider compatibility to Chef/CircleCI/Github/Other Automation tools, atleast as externally added plugins

# Status

* In Active Development (taskcontrol version 1.2.6)
* In Active Development (Common Integrations and Activities as Plugins)
