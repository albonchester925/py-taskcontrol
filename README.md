# taskcontrol
    Create named workflow task controls and run the tasks with respective before and after middlewares

taskcontrol is a python library to create tasks in and based on named workflow controls. It allows middlewares before and after each task. taskcontrol can run single or multiple tasks at a task run invocation.

It provides a simple decorator called `workflow` that takes the name, task_instance, task_order, task_global, before, after arguments to set up the named workflow control.

# Installation

##### Command:

    pip3 install taskcontrol

##### Package Link:
    
    https://github.com/ganeshkbhat/taskcontrol
    https://pypi.org/project/taskcontrol/

# Features

* Create task controls (tasks)
* Named workflow tasks
* Single or multiple tasks
* Workflow decorator with simple options to setup workflow
* Allows middlewares before each task (data fetch, auth, etc)
* Allows middlewares after each task (data save, logging, logout, cleanup, etc)
* Allows merging to instances of task controls
* In-Development: Allows creating shared/common task controls
* In-Development: Allows creating and registering a set of task controls as a plugin
* In-Development: Allows adding a plugin to your task controls

##### Package Dependencies:

* None

##### Quick Demo:

```javascript


# for git development repo
# from src.workflow import workflow, Tasks


# for package
from taskcontrol import workflow, Tasks


# Instance of tasks object
# Every instance will store it own list of tasks 
#       with their before/after middlewares
t = Task()


def test(k, c, d):
    print("Running my Middleware Function: test - task items", k, c, d)


@workflow(
    name="taskname",
    task_order=1,
    task_instance = t,
    shared=True,
    before=[
        # before middleware order followed will be of the list sequence
        {
            "function": test,
            "args": [11, 12],
            "kwargs": {"d": "Before Testing message Middleware "},

            # options { error : str,  error_next_value: Object, error_handler: function }
            #
            # error { str }: [next, error_handler, exit]
            # error_handler { function }
            # error_next_value { object }
            #
            # Usage:
            # "options": {"error": "next", "error_next_value": "value"}
            # "options": {"error": "exit"}
            # "options": {

                #
                # Implementation One:
                #   if error_next_value defined
                #       lambda err, value: (err, error_next_value)
                # Implementation Two:
                #   if error_next_value not defined
                #       lambda err, value: (err, None)
                #
                # Returning the two value tuple in error_handler implementation is compulsary
                #       err is the error that occurred
                #       error_next_value is error_next_value provided in options
                #
